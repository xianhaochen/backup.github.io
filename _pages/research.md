### End-to-end service auction for edge computing ### [ToN2022](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9790890/authors#authors) [WCM2022](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9773059)

Auction mechanism design has gained tremendous attention from the networking community over the past decades due to its ability to enable efficient network resource sharing over different parties. However, auction implementation for wireless networks has rarely been seen in reality. A major reason is that traditional auction schemes generally ask buyers to select and bid for resources (e.g., spectrum bands), thus incurring excessive complexity on the user side.

Indeed, what end users care about the most is whether their services with the desired end-to-end (E2E) quality of service (QoS) can be provided, and they do not really care how much resources they are allocated. In response to this demand, we propose the E2E service auction framework for edge computing systems, where the auction commodities are E2E services rather than specific resources. There are two benefits of this architecture. First, it significantly lowers the barrier to participating in the auction because buyers simply bid for services with E2E QoS requirements without having to know the inner workings. Second, it provides E2E QoS guarantees for edge computing services by taking both communication and computing resource optimization into account, unlike existing auction schemes trading either communications or computing resource alone.

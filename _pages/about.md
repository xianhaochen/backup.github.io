I will be joining [the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, the University of Hong Kong](https://www.eee.hku.hk/), as an assistant professor. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Florida in 2022, and my B.Eng. degree from Southwest
Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 2017.

5G/6G is no longer just for information delivery, but rather becoming a concerted platform for integrated communications and computing. I am interested in exploring the following key problems in 5G/6G.

federated learning, edge computing, vehicular networks. 

*Multiple PhD and Postdoc openings are available in HKU. Please drop me emails if you are intereted.*

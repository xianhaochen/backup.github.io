I will be joining the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, the University of Hong Kong](https://www.eee.hku.hk/), as an assistant professor. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Florida in 2022, and my B.Eng. degree from Southwest
Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 2017. 

Research interest: federated learning, edge computing, vehicular networks. 
*Multiple PhD and Postdoc openings in HKU EEE are available. Please drop me emails if you are intereted.*

<!-- ### Highlights

1. Four of my papers are highly cited and ranked top 20 globally in recent 5 years in Google scholar metrics! See [here](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/421192644).
2. I wrote a popular book [迁移学习导论](http://jd92.wang/tlbook) to make it easy to learn, understand, and use transfer learning.
3. I lead the most popular transfer learning and semi-supervised learning projects on Github: [Transfer learning repo](https://github/jindongwang/transferlearning) [![Transfer learning repo](/assets/img/transferlearning-repo-star.jpg)](https://github/jindongwang/transferlearning) and  [Semi-supervised learning repo](https://github/torchssl/torchssl) [![SSL repo](/assets/img/torchssl-star.jpg)](https://github/stars/torchssl/torchssl)

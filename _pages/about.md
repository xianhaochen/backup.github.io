Assistant Professor, The University of Hong Kong<br>
Email: xchen [at] eee.hku.hk

I am an assistant professor at [the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, the University of Hong Kong](https://www.eee.hku.hk/), leading the <strong>W</strong>ireless <strong>I</strong>nformation & Inte<strong>ll</strong>igence (<strong>WILL</strong>) lab. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Florida in 2022, advised by [Prof. Yuguang Fang](http://www.fang.ece.ufl.edu/), and my B.Eng. degree from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 2017. I received 2022 ECE graduate excellence award for research from the University of Florida.

**If you are interested in working with me as a Ph.D. student/Postdoc, please feel free to drop me an email including your CV, transcript, and sample publications (if any).** Due to the volume of email inquiries, I may only be able to contact shortlisted candidates (usually in one week). Thanks for your understanding.

#### Research Interests ####

The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution opens vast opportunities for wireless networking researchers. 5G/6G is expected to be no longer just for information delivery, but rather serve as an integrated communication and computing platform to “intelligentize” our world. In response to this observation, we will explore various research problems in 5G/6G, particularly the joint design of communications and computing/AI based on the end-to-end design principle. My research interests include

- Wireless networking for computing/machine learning
  - Edge computing
  - Edge learning (e.g., federated learning and split learning)

- Machine learning for wireless networking
  - Reinforcement learning for network optimization
 
- Vehicular networking
  - Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs)

- Incentive design for wireless networks
  - Auction design
  - Game theory

### Research Interests ###

5G/6G is no longer just for information delivery, but rather becoming an integrated communications and computing platform intended to intelligentize everything in our world. I am interested in exploring various research problems in 5G/6G, particularly the joint design of communications and computing, including

- Wireless networking for computing/machine learning
  - Edge computing
  - Edge learning (e.g., federated learning and split learning)

- Machine learning for wireless networking
  - Reinforcement learning for network optimization
 
- Vehicular networking
  - Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs)

- Incentive design for wireless networks
  - Auction design
  - Game theory
